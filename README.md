# Translator
For my second project I experimented with a translation python library called Translate and the open and read python functions. With these tools I made a translator that reads whatever you write in a text document and gives you the Japanese translation.

To use this program:
1)	Type “$ pip install translate” in your terminal 
2)	Save a text document named translations.txt in the same folder you download this code into 
3)	Type whatever message you want into the text doc and save 
4)	Run the program
